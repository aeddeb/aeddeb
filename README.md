### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ This is Ali Eddeb and welcome to my profile!

ðŸ˜„ I am data explorer and python enthusiast. I enjoy using python to extract insights from data and to build machine learning models.

:computer: Iâ€™m currently working on a COD Warzone performance enhancer (not aimbot!!). You can check out my progress <a href="https://github.com/aeddeb/Predicting-Warzone-Wins-Based-on-Player-Performance">here</a>.

:soccer: I also love playing soccer but I think robots are still a ways away from competing with humans.
